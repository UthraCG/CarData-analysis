Aim:
  To predict the present price of the car by considering its make, year of make, selling price and etc.
Process:

step1:Cleaning the data.

Step2:Finding the dependent variable using test.

Step3:Plotting graphs for visualized understanding.

Step4: Correlation test.

Step5:Changing categorical value into numerical value using label encoder.

step6:Changing the values between 0 to 1 using minmax scaler.

step7:Training dataset using Random Forest Regressor.

Step8:Predicting values for y.

step9:Finding the metrics, accuracy using root mean square error. 

Result:

Now the model is trained and fit in algorithm and the value of RMSE is found.
